# Overview

This is my solution to the [Shopping Cart](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) project from The Odin Project. 

### The challenge

The challenge is to create a online store with a fully funational shopping cart.

This was my third "real" React project, here I used "React Router" for the very first time.
I used the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to gather all of the products information which is shown in the shop. 

### Functionalities

- The customer can browse through all of the shown products, which are gathered throught the API. When a product is clicked, it leads the customer to a dedicated page for the the specific product.
- The customer can select the quantity of the products he wants to add to his shopping cart. If he decides to change the quantity later, he can still do that from the cart itself. There is also an option to delete the whole product from the shopping cart.
- The cart can be viewed as a popup throught the ðŸ›’ icon in the top right corner, and as a whole dedicated page by pressing the "Cart" text in the navigation bar.
- The total price of the cart is calculated after every product change, and the content in the cart is memorized so when the customer change the page, the cart content is not affected.
